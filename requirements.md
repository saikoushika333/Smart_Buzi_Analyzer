# Smart Location-Based Business Feasibility AI

## 1. Problem Statement
Many small and medium entrepreneurs fail because they choose business locations without data-driven insights. Factors such as competition density, land cost, customer demand, and operational risk are often ignored, leading to high failure rates. There is no unified AI-driven system that evaluates location suitability, cost estimation, and business risk together in a simple and accessible manner.

## 2. Objective
The objective of this project is to build an AI-powered decision-support system that helps entrepreneurs identify the most suitable locations for a given business type and predicts success and failure probability before investment.

## 3. Scope of the Solution
- Suggest suitable business locations based on user input
- Analyze competitor presence using historical datasets
- Estimate setup cost and expected profit
- Calculate business risk score
- Predict success and failure percentage using machine learning
- Provide explainable insights instead of raw predictions

## 4. Target Users
- Small business owners
- Startups and first-time entrepreneurs
- Urban planners and investors
- Government and incubation centers

## 5. Key Features
- Location-based business feasibility analysis
- Cost estimation based on area and locality
- Competitor density analysis
- ML-driven success vs failure prediction
- AI-generated business insights
- API-based architecture for scalability

## 6. Input Parameters
- Business type
- Location (latitude & longitude)
- Area size (sq. meters)
- Budget constraints (optional)

## 7. Output
- Location suitability score
- Estimated investment cost
- Risk level (Low / Medium / High)
- Success percentage
- Failure percentage
- AI-generated explanation

## 8. Technology Stack
- Python (Machine Learning & API)
- FastAPI for model serving
- n8n for workflow automation
- Google Gemini LLM for insights
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Ngrok for API exposure

## 9. Expected Impact
This solution reduces business failures by enabling informed decisions, promotes sustainable entrepreneurship, and supports data-driven planning for urban business ecosystems.
