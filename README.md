🚀 SMART BUZI ANALYZER
AI-Driven Business Feasibility & Location Intelligence Platform
📌 Project Overview

SMART BUZI ANALYZER is an AI-powered autonomous business feasibility agent designed to help entrepreneurs make data-driven decisions before investing their hard-earned money.

By combining machine learning models, geospatial intelligence, and large language models (LLMs), the system predicts:

Business success and failure probability

Financial feasibility and profitability

Location suitability and competition intensity

Key risks that could lead to business failure

Traditionally, entrepreneurs spend 6 to 8 months surveying locations, competitors, and costs.
SMART BUZI ANALYZER reduces this entire process to minutes, without compromising accuracy or insights.

❗ The Problem We Are Solving

Starting a business today is risky, expensive, and uncertain:

20–22% of new businesses fail within the first year

Nearly 50% fail within the first five years

Some startups experience failure rates as high as 90% in the long term

Despite passion and effort, many entrepreneurs are forced to make critical decisions in the dark, relying on assumptions instead of evidence. As a result, dreams often collide with harsh reality.

🔍 Root Causes of Business Failure

Most business failures are not due to bad ideas, but due to lack of awareness and planning, including:

Poor understanding of location suitability, population density, foot traffic, and nearby competitors

No clarity on investment recovery timeline (break-even period)

Limited insight into financial and operational risks before launching the business

This knowledge gap is especially challenging for first-time entrepreneurs and small business owners.
